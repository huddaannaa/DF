# Understanding MBR Sections with Python: A Deep Dive into the `extract_mbr_sections` Function

Master Boot Record (MBR) is a crucial structure used to define the partitions on a storage device. Analyzing the MBR can provide insights into how data is organized and accessed. In this article, we'll walk through a Python function, `extract_mbr_sections`, which reads and deciphers the MBR of a given disk image file.

## Function Overview

The `extract_mbr_sections` function reads specific sections of the MBR and displays their hexadecimal and ASCII representations. Additionally, it decodes the partition entries to provide detailed information about each partition.

### Function Definition

```python
def extract_mbr_sections(filename):
    SECTOR_SIZE = 512  # bytes
    
    sections = {
        "Boot Code": (0x000, 0x1BD),
        "Partition 1": (0x1BE, 0x1CD),
        "Partition 2": (0x1CE, 0x1DD),
        "Partition 3": (0x1DE, 0x1ED),
        "Partition 4": (0x1EE, 0x1FD),
        "Boot Signature": (0x1FE, 0x1FF)
    }
    
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        for section, (start, end) in sections.items():
            f.seek(start)
            chunk = f.read(end - start + 1)
            hex_values = " ".join([f"{byte:02x}" for byte in chunk])
            
            # Display ASCII characters on the side
            ascii_values = "".join([chr(byte) if 32 <= byte < 127 else "." for byte in chunk])
            
            print(f"{section} ({start:#04x} – {end:#04x}):")
            print(hex_values.upper() + "  " + ascii_values)
            
            # Decode the partition entry if it's one of the partitions
            if "Partition" in section:
                status = "Active" if chunk[0] == 0x80 else "Inactive"
                partition_type = chunk[4]
                lba_address = int.from_bytes(chunk[8:12], 'little')
                number_of_sectors = int.from_bytes(chunk[12:16], 'little')
                
                size_in_bytes = number_of_sectors * SECTOR_SIZE
                byte_offset = lba_address * SECTOR_SIZE
                byte_offset_hex = hex(byte_offset)
                
                print(f"  Status: {status}")
                print(f"  Partition Type: {partition_type:#04x}")
                print(f"  LBA Address: {lba_address}")
                print(f"  Number of Sectors: {number_of_sectors}")
                print(f"  Size in bytes: {size_in_bytes}")
                print(f"  Byte offset address for start of file system: {byte_offset} ({byte_offset_hex})")
            
            print()
```

### Key Components

1. **Constants and Sections**:
   - `SECTOR_SIZE` is defined as 512 bytes, which is the standard size for a disk sector.
   - The `sections` dictionary specifies the start and end offsets for different sections within the MBR.

2. **File Handling**:
   - The function opens the specified file in binary mode (`'rb'`).
   - For each section defined in the `sections` dictionary, the function seeks to the start offset, reads the specified number of bytes, and processes the data.

3. **Hexadecimal and ASCII Representation**:
   - The function converts the read bytes into a string of hexadecimal values.
   - It also generates an ASCII representation, substituting non-printable characters with a dot (`.`).

4. **Partition Entry Decoding**:
   - For each partition entry, the function decodes the status (active/inactive), partition type, LBA (Logical Block Addressing) address, number of sectors, and calculates the size in bytes and byte offset for the start of the file system.

### Example Output

Running the function with an MBR file as input would produce output similar to the following:

```
Boot Code (0x00 – 0x1bd):
FA 33 C0 8E D0 BC 00 7C .... 00 00 55 AA  .

Partition 1 (0x1be – 0x1cd):
80 01 01 00 07 FE FF FF 3F 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00  .........?.......

  Status: Active
  Partition Type: 0x07
  LBA Address: 63
  Number of Sectors: 16777215
  Size in bytes: 8589934592
  Byte offset address for start of file system: 32256 (0x7e00)

...

Boot Signature (0x1fe – 0x1ff):
55 AA  U.
```


The `extract_mbr_sections` function provides a detailed breakdown of the MBR, including both raw hexadecimal data and human-readable interpretations of partition entries. This function can be extremely useful for anyone needing to analyze or troubleshoot disk structures at a low level. Understanding the MBR is fundamental for tasks ranging from data recovery to forensic analysis, making such tools indispensable for professionals in these fields.
