#### Abstract
Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI) is a critical aspect of digital forensics, involving the systematic approach to investigating incidents involving digital devices. This story explores the stages of DISI, from preparation to presentation, detailing the processes involved in acquiring and examining digital evidence.

#### Introduction
Digital incidents involve any events where digital devices are part of the crime scene. Understanding the process of investigating these incidents is crucial for forensic analysts. This story outlines the stages of Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI), emphasizing the importance of each step in ensuring comprehensive and accurate forensic analysis.

The process of Digital Incident Scene Investigation is structured into several key stages, each playing a vital role in the overall investigation.

| Stage            | Description                                                                                       | Example                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Preparation**  | Initial stage involving planning and readiness for the investigation.                             | Gathering tools and defining procedures. |
| **Identification**| Identifying potential evidence sources at the scene.                                             | Locating digital devices and relevant data. |
| **Acquisition**  | Collecting digital images and data from identified sources.                                       | Creating forensic images of hard drives. |
| **Examination**  | Analyzing the acquired data to identify artifacts, indicators, and patterns.                      | Using forensic tools to analyze file structures and metadata. |
| **Presentation** | Reporting the findings of the investigation.                                                      | Preparing detailed reports and presenting evidence in court. |

#### The Story of a Digital Incident Scene Investigation

Meet Alice, a digital forensics investigator tasked with a new case involving a suspected data breach at a corporate office. The investigation unfolds through several key stages, each playing a vital role in the overall process.

#### Stage 1: Preparation
The journey begins with **Preparation**. Alice knows that thorough planning and readiness are essential. She gathers her forensic toolkit, which includes hardware and software tools needed for the investigation. She ensures that all legal authorizations are in place, ready to proceed without any legal hindrances.

| **Preparation** |
|-----------------|
| **Definition**: This stage involves planning and ensuring readiness for the investigation. |
| **Activities**: Gathering necessary tools, defining procedures, and ensuring legal authorizations are in place. |
| **Example**: Alice gathers tools and defines procedures before starting the investigation. |

#### Stage 2: Identification
With everything prepared, Alice moves to the **Identification** stage. Arriving at the crime scene, she identifies potential evidence sources. She locates computers, mobile phones, and external storage devices that might contain relevant data related to the data breach.

| **Identification** |
|---------------------|
| **Definition**: Identifying potential evidence sources within the digital incident scene. |
| **Activities**: Locating digital devices, such as computers, mobile phones, and storage media, that might contain relevant data. |
| **Example**: Alice locates digital devices and relevant data at the crime scene. |

#### Stage 3: Acquisition
Next, Alice focuses on **Acquisition**. She meticulously collects digital images and data from the identified sources. Using forensic tools, she creates forensic images of hard drives and copies data from mobile devices, ensuring that all data is captured in a forensically sound manner.

| **Acquisition** |
|------------------|
| **Definition**: Collecting digital data from the identified sources. |
| **Activities**: Creating forensic images of hard drives, copying data from mobile devices, and capturing network traffic. |
| **Example**: Alice creates forensic images of hard drives to collect digital data. |

#### Stage 4: Examination
With the data safely acquired, Alice proceeds to the **Examination** stage. She uses advanced forensic tools to analyze the acquired data. During this phase, she recovers deleted files, examines file systems, and identifies metadata. Her goal is to uncover artifacts, indicators, and patterns that provide insights into the data breach.

| **Examination** |
|------------------|
| **Definition**: Analyzing the acquired data to identify relevant artifacts, indicators, and patterns. |
| **Activities**: Using forensic tools to analyze file systems, recover deleted files, and identify metadata. |
| **Example**: Alice uses forensic tools to analyze file structures and metadata. |

#### Stage 5: Presentation
The final stage is **Presentation**. Alice compiles her findings into a comprehensive report. She prepares visual representations of the data and organizes her evidence in a clear and concise manner. Finally, she presents her findings, ready to support legal proceedings and provide detailed evidence in court.

| **Presentation** |
|-------------------|
| **Definition**: Reporting the findings of the investigation in a clear and concise manner. |
| **Activities**: Preparing detailed reports, creating visual representations of data, and presenting evidence in legal settings. |
| **Example**: Alice prepares detailed reports and presents evidence in court. |

#### Flow of the Digital Incident Scene Investigation Diagram

The diagram illustrates the process of Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI) from the initial preparation stage to the final presentation of digital evidence. Hereâ€™s a summary of the flow:

1. **Preparation**:
   - This stage involves planning and ensuring readiness for the investigation, including gathering tools and defining procedures.

2. **Identification**:
   - At the scene of the digital incident, potential evidence sources are identified, such as digital devices involved in the incident.

3. **Acquisition**:
   - Digital images and data are collected from the identified sources. This includes creating forensic images of digital devices and capturing relevant data.

4. **Examination**:
   - The acquired data is analyzed to identify artifacts, indicators, and patterns. Forensic tools are used to examine the data for relevant information.

5. **Presentation**:
   - The findings from the examination are compiled into a report. The digital evidence is presented, often in legal settings, with detailed information about the artifacts and indicators found during the investigation.

6. **Artifacts, Indicators, and Patterns**:
   - During the examination phase, analysts look for specific artifacts, indicators, and patterns within the data that can provide insights into the digital incident.

7. **Digital Evidence**:
   - The culmination of the investigation process is the presentation of digital evidence, which includes the compiled information and findings from the analysis.

#### Conclusion
Understanding the stages of Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI) is essential for conducting thorough and effective forensic investigations. Each stage, from preparation to presentation, plays a crucial role in ensuring that digital evidence is accurately identified, acquired, examined, and reported. This systematic approach helps forensic analysts to uncover crucial information, support legal proceedings, and contribute to the resolution of digital incidents.
