#### Abstract
Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) involves the identification, collection, analysis, and preservation of digital evidence. This paper explores the detailed structure of digital evidence in storage media, focusing on the representation of data in hexadecimal format for easier analysis. Understanding how data is stored and represented in different formats is crucial for effective digital forensics.

#### Introduction
In digital forensics, analyzing the data stored on storage media is a fundamental task. This paper provides a detailed explanation of how data is represented and analyzed using hexadecimal editors. The focus is on understanding the transition from binary data to more readable formats such as ASCII, hexadecimal, and decimal.

#### Digital Evidence Structure in Storage Media

The structure of digital evidence in storage media involves several hierarchical layers, each playing a critical role in the storage and retrieval of data. This section explains how data from a sector is represented and analyzed.

| Layer      | Description                                                                                  | Example                       |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Sector** | The basic or smallest unit of storage on a Hard Disk Drive (HDD).                             | One sector containing 512 bytes of data. |
| **Cluster**| Made up of a combination of multiple sectors.                                                | A cluster that contains two sectors.    |
| **Byte**   | The basic unit of digital data, consisting of 8 bits.                                         | A single byte within a sector.          |
| **Bits**   | The smallest unit of data in computing, represented as a 0 or 1.                              | A byte consists of 8 bits.              |

#### Number Systems in Data Representation

| Number System    | Description                                                                                  | Example                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Binary**       | A sequence of 0s and 1s representing digital data.                                           | Binary representation of the byte 01000001. |
| **Nibble**       | A 4-bit aggregation, half of a byte.                                                         | The byte 01000001 is divided into two nibbles: 0100 and 0001.              |
| **Hexadecimal**  | A base-16 number system used for more convenient and readable representation of binary data. | The byte 01000001 is represented as 0x41 in hexadecimal.                   |
| **Decimal**      | A base-10 number system.                                                                     | The hexadecimal value 0x41 is equivalent to the decimal value 65.          |

#### Using a Hex Editor

| Aspect                | Description                                                                                           | Example                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hex Editors**       | Tools that display data in hexadecimal format, allowing analysts to examine and manipulate the binary data. | Hex editors can display data in various formats such as ASCII, decimal, and hexadecimal. |
| **Hexadecimal Representation** | Hexadecimal is often used because it is more concise and readable compared to binary.           | The byte 01000001 is represented as 0x41 in hex.           |
| **Conversion**        | The process of converting binary data to hexadecimal and other formats.                               | From Binary to Hex: The binary value 01000001 converts to 0x41 in hex. <br> From Hex to ASCII: The hex value 0x41 corresponds to the ASCII character 'A'. <br> From Hex to Decimal: The hex value 0x41 equals 65 in decimal. |

#### Flow of the Digital Incident Scene Investigation Diagram

The diagram illustrates the process of Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI) from the initial preparation stage to the final presentation of digital evidence. Hereâ€™s a summary of the flow:

1. **Preparation**:
   - This stage involves planning and ensuring readiness for the investigation, including gathering tools and defining procedures.

2. **Identification**:
   - At the scene of the digital incident, potential evidence sources are identified, such as digital devices involved in the incident.

3. **Acquisition**:
   - Digital images and data are collected from the identified sources. This includes creating forensic images of digital devices and capturing relevant data.

4. **Examination**:
   - The acquired data is analyzed to identify artifacts, indicators, and patterns. Forensic tools are used to examine the data for relevant information.

5. **Presentation**:
   - The findings from the examination are compiled into a report. The digital evidence is presented, often in legal settings, with detailed information about the artifacts and indicators found during the investigation.

6. **Artifacts, Indicators, and Patterns**:
   - During the examination phase, analysts look for specific artifacts, indicators, and patterns within the data that can provide insights into the digital incident.

7. **Digital Evidence**:
   - The culmination of the investigation process is the presentation of digital evidence, which includes the compiled information and findings from the analysis.

#### Conclusion
Understanding the stages of Digital Incident Scene Investigation (DISI) is essential for conducting thorough and effective forensic investigations. Each stage, from preparation to presentation, plays a crucial role in ensuring that digital evidence is accurately identified, acquired, examined, and reported. This systematic approach helps forensic analysts to uncover crucial information, support legal proceedings, and contribute to the resolution of digital incidents.
